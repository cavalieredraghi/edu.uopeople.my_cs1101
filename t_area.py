#If this is peer reviewed, than I will take some time to explain comments.
#Comments like this one are to explain the pieces of the code that go before them.
#they can also be used to help organize and seperate your different segments of code.
#I personally think the more comments the better, rather then having to few.

#This line of code here is simulating the formula for a triangle's area. 
area = height*(base*.5)

#This allows you to pull from the computation what you wish. Here I am pulling the area variable above.
print(area)
